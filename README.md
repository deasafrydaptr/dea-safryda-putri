<b>Information System graduate</b> with a passion for <b>Data and Tech</b>, which has driven me to pursue a career in this field.

In addition, I also have <b>a keen interest in Python programming, web programming, and a curiosity about cloud computing</b>. These complementary interests have enabled me to develop a versatile skill set that I believe will <i>contribute effectively to various aspects of the tech industry</i>.
